- Add PRC support. Unlike PDBs, the thing to do here is to have
  registered handlers for various resource types.
- Add methods for adding, removing categories, when the AppInfo block
  uses the standard layout.
	Possibly define Palm::RAW::std_addCategory, std_deleteCategory
  (or something) and let the modules that inherit "Raw" say
	*addCategory = *std_addCategory;
	*deleteCategory = *std_deleteCategory;
  and inherit those.
	Or maybe add a ":std-categories" argument to &import that'll
  export Palm::RAW::std_addCategory to <caller>::addCategory.
	Or maybe just do it by hand:
	sub Palm::Address::addCategory { return Palm::Raw::std_addCategory; }
