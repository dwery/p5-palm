=head1 NAME

Palm::Address - Handler for Palm AddressBook databases

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Palm::Address;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Address PDB handler is a helper class for the Palm::PDB package.
It parses AddressBook databases.

=head2 AppInfo block

The AppInfo block begins with standard category support. See
L<Palm::StdAppInfo> for details.

Other fields include:

    $pdb->{appinfo}{lastUniqueID}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{dirtyFields}

I don't know what these are.

    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{name}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{firstName}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{company}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{phone1}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{phone2}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{phone3}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{phone4}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{phone5}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{phone6}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{phone7}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{phone8}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{address}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{city}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{state}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{zipCode}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{country}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{title}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{custom1}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{custom2}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{custom3}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{custom4}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{fieldLabels}{note}

These are the names of the various fields in the address record.

    $pdb->{appinfo}{country}

An integer: the code for the country for which these labels were
designed. The country name is available as

        $Palm::Address::countries[$pdb->{appinfo}{country}];

    $pdb->{appinfo}{misc}

An integer. The least-significant bit is a flag that indicates whether
the database should be sorted by company. The other bits are reserved.

=head2 Sort block

    $pdb->{sort}

This is a scalar, the raw data of the sort block.

=head2 Records

    $record = $pdb->{records}[N];

    $record->{fields}{name}
    $record->{fields}{firstName}
    $record->{fields}{company}
    $record->{fields}{phone1}
    $record->{fields}{phone2}
    $record->{fields}{phone3}
    $record->{fields}{phone4}
    $record->{fields}{phone5}
    $record->{fields}{address}
    $record->{fields}{city}
    $record->{fields}{state}
    $record->{fields}{zipCode}
    $record->{fields}{country}
    $record->{fields}{title}
    $record->{fields}{custom1}
    $record->{fields}{custom2}
    $record->{fields}{custom3}
    $record->{fields}{custom4}
    $record->{fields}{note}

These are scalars, the values of the various address book fields.

    $record->{phoneLabel}{phone1}
    $record->{phoneLabel}{phone2}
    $record->{phoneLabel}{phone3}
    $record->{phoneLabel}{phone4}
    $record->{phoneLabel}{phone5}

Most fields in an AddressBook record are straightforward: the "name"
field always gives the person's last name.

The "phoneI<N>" fields, on the other hand, can mean different things
in different records. There are five such fields in each record, each
of which can take on one of eight different values: "Work", "Home",
"Fax", "Other", "E-mail", "Main", "Pager" and "Mobile".

The $record->{phoneLabel}{phone*} fields are integers. Each one is
an index into @Palm::Address::phoneLabels, and indicates which
particular type of phone number each of the $record->{phone*} fields
represents.

    $record->{phoneLabel}{display}

Like the phone* fields above, this is an index into
@Palm::Address::phoneLabels. It indicates which of the phone*
fields to display in the list view.

    $record->{phoneLabel}{reserved}

I don't know what this is.

Use this method if you're creating an Address PDB from scratch.

Creates a new Address record, with blank values for all of the fields.

you want C<$pdb-E<gt>append_Record>.

# ParseRecord
# Parse an Address Book record.

# Address book records have the following overall structure:
#	1: phone labels
#	2: field map
#	3: fields

# Each record can contain a number of fields, such as "name",
# "address", "city", "company", and so forth. Each field has an
# internal name ("zipCode"), a printable name ("Zip Code"), and a
# value ("90210").
#
# For most fields, there is a hard mapping between internal and
# printed names: "name" always corresponds to "Last Name". The fields
# "phone1" through "phone5" are different: each of these can be mapped
# to one of several printed names: "Work", "Home", "Fax", "Other",
# "E-Mail", "Main", "Pager" or "Mobile". Multiple internal names can
# map to the same printed name (a person might have several e-mail
# addresses), and the mapping is part of the record (i.e., each record
# has its own mapping).
#
# Part (3) is simply a series of NUL-terminated strings, giving the
# values of the various fields in the record, in a certain order. If a
# record does not have a given field, there is no string corresponding
# to it in this part.
#
# Part (2) is a bit field that specifies which fields the record
# contains.
#
# Part (1) determines the phone mapping described above. This is
# implemented as an unsigned long, but what we're interested in are
# the six least-significant nybbles. They are:
#	disp	phone5	phone4	phone3	phone2	phone1
# ("phone1" is the least-significant nybble). Each nybble holds a
# value in the range 0-15 which in turn specifies the printed name for
# that particular internal name.
