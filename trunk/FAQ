Q: I'm trying to read the "datebook.dat", "address.dat", "todo.dat" or
   "memopad.dat" files created by the HotSync desktop tool, but it
   doesn't work.

A: Those files aren't PDB files, so these modules can't read them. It
   looks as if the HotSync conduits don't store a backup PDB file of
   the database.
	In any case, I don't know what format those files are in.
