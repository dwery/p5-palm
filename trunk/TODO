- Add PRC support. Unlike PDBs, the thing to do here is to have
  registered handlers for various resource types.
- Add methods for adding, removing categories, when the AppInfo block
  uses the standard layout.
- When creating a new PDB with 'sub new' in a helper, lots of fields
  are left undefined. This makes 'perl -w' unhappy.
