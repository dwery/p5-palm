* INSTALLING:

	This is pretty standard:
	- Run "perl Makefile.PL" to create the Makefile.
	- Run "make" to build everything.
	- Run "make install" to install the package.
Easy, huh?

* DOCUMENTATION:

	All documentation is in the form of PODs embedded in the
module files themselves. Use
	pod2text Palm/PDB.pm
to read the documentation for Palm::PDB.
	You'll want to start with Palm::PDB, then Palm::Raw, then the
others.

	If you have any comments, suggestions, bug reports, patches,
